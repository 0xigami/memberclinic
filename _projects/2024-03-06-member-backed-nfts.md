we've been very fortunate to work closely with [mint.club](https://mint.club) on our flagship example of member backed assets. by visiting [coinmembercap.com](https://coinmembercap.com/) you'll quickly realise how popular this experiment has been with the farcaster community.

in collaboration with mint.club and [yougogirl.eth](https://warpcast.com/yougogirl.eth), we produced a [farcaster frame](https://warpcast.com/gami/0xbe6af682) that scans a user's pfp, determines a colour palette, and applies it to their own custom member pfp in one click. a second click takes the user to deploy their new generative art as a member backed 1155 nft on a bonding curve. nicknamed "frametech," the project is effectively friendtech on farcaster, with many possibilities for the hundreds of users who've deployed from their fid.

members understand the importance of liquidity when it comes to growth, therefore a well designed liquidity mining program has been implemented. the "[member el pee](https://www.coinvise.co/gami)" program rewards 20% of member token supply to uniswap v3 liquidity providers on 0.3% fee.

thanks to the fine folks at coinvise, custom unsiwap integration facilitates a simple claim mechanism, from which liquidity providers can withdraw rewards once thresholds are met. the program is strictly first come, first served, and reward tiers are structured as follows:

<div class="table-container">
  <table>
    <tr><th>tier</th><th>liquidity amount</th><th>duration</th><th>reward (member)</th><th>total claims</th></tr>
    <tr><td><a href="https://www.coinvise.co/gami/el-pee-gold" target="_blank">gold</a></td><td>$1,000 USD</td><td>42 days</td><td>10,000,000</td><td>30</td></tr>
    <tr><td><a href="https://www.coinvise.co/gami/el-pee-silver" target="_blank">silver</a></td><td>$500 USD</td><td>35 days</td><td>3,500,000</td><td>100</td></tr>
    <tr><td><a href="https://www.coinvise.co/gami/el-pee-bronze" target="_blank">bronze</a></td><td>$100 USD</td><td>28 days</td><td>500,000</td><td>300</td></tr>
  </table>
</div>

claims are open and early liquidity providers, who've supported the project since day one, are encouraged to visit our convise claims page once the 30 day minimum has been met. if you're unsure if this is you, simply check days since your relevant transactions on basescan.

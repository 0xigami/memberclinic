jokes aside, member is an erc20 meme [token](https://basescan.org/token/0x7d89e05c0b93b24b5cb23a073e60d008fed1acf9) deployed by [gami.eth](https://warpcast.com/gami) on base. originally called mlm, as in multi-level marketing, it was a satire of crypto pyramid schemes. 

```
base:0x7d89e05c0b93b24b5cb23a073e60d008fed1acf9
```

during a free nft drop on zora, mlmfer, which served as a commemorative launch announcement, [taliskye.eth](https://warpcast.com/taliskye) left a [mint comment](https://tokenchat.co/comment/0x867f2b14f421c43155a915cf5da92f276d9ccd1d692818d6f89e6dfd516ff953) that read, "member go up." 

## ‚úÖ certified organic

an immediate rebrand paid homage to the organic emergence of a genius phallic spin on an age old crypto meme, "number go up." despite the rebrand, gami.eth proceeded to airdrop 50% of the token supply, as planned, on 14k+ nft collectors who'd previously supported his work.

the member distribution served a show of his appreciation to collectors of his works including [gnars](https://opensea.io/collection/gnars-v2), nouns hd on [zora](https://opensea.io/collection/nouns-hd) and [base](https://opensea.io/collection/nouns-hd-base), and [defrauds](https://zora.co/collect/eth:0xf7f9c097eabf928fbd8df6e056f9a01cabafb54d), as well as other select nfts, released as free mints on [zora](https://zora.co/gami.eth). collectors of various friends' collections were also included, as were those who completed various social proofs of work on farcaster and beyond.

## üßë‚Äçüî¨ nutting edge

as a token on [base](https://www.base.org/), the vision for member, is that it also serves as a [base token](https://tradingstrategy.ai/glossary/base-token). for example, $member = base token, while /member = "base token." ideally it's utilised as a platform, on which the community can conduct any number of experiments denominated in member, and it's with this in mind that careful consideration was given to tokenomics:

**4,025,000,000 max total supply**

- 50% airdropped to an existing support network
- 20% allocated to [LP rewards](https://www.coinvise.co/gami) program contract
- 14% creation of initial uniswap v3 [liquidity pool](https://basescan.org/token/0x03a520b32c04bf3beef7beb72e919cf822ed34f1?a=0xf2a6f079f507a3a1b70f8a1943b434e194c036ee)
- 10% [ecosystem fund](https://basescan.org/token/0x7d89e05c0b93b24b5cb23a073e60d008fed1acf9?a=0xf2a6f079f507a3a1b70f8a1943b434e194c036ee) held in dao treasury ‚åê‚ó®-‚ó® 
- 5% [meme rewards](https://basescan.org/token/0x7d89e05c0b93b24b5cb23a073e60d008fed1acf9?a=0x45ce283c2a12df1bf69802fd2c1e5398228f939d) program contract allocation
- 1% commitment made to [protocol guild pledge](https://twitter.com/ProtocolGuild/status/1757913091462041621)

**<span id="api-data-header">loading...</span> circulating supply (live data)**

- [total supply](https://api.member.clinic/total_supply.txt) - `https://api.member.clinic/total_supply.txt`
- [circulating supply](https://api.member.clinic/circulating_supply.txt) - `https://api.member.clinic/circulating_supply.txt`

the member [dao treasury](https://basescan.org/token/0x03a520b32c04bf3beef7beb72e919cf822ed34f1?a=0xf2a6f079f507a3a1b70f8a1943b434e194c036ee) also holds the initial uniswap v3 liquidity position, meaning it's effectively locked behind decentralised, fully onchain governance. member token itself does not have voting rights. instead, anyone is able to bid in daily nft auctions with eth to join.

this is thanks to [nouns.build](https://nouns.build/dao/base/0xFBfe187b444798214Dd4BbfAdE369F8DC3864C6a/29?tab=about) and their builder protocol. establishing a nounish dao is a meaningful step towards the long term viability of member token and helps foster a culture of collective creation. dao members are able to submit proposals and vote on how the ecosystem fund will be used, including eth, member, and any other token balances.

## üìü meme technology

members pride themselves on being early adopters of the latest and greatest technologies for meme proliferation. we've been very fortunate to establish effective flywheels for the creation, distribution, and remuneration of memes produced by the community. 

### üí∏ memes for member

[memes for member](https://uplink.wtf/member/mintboard) encourages members to create their best member memes, post them to our mintboard, earn zora protocol rewards (eth) when collected, and earn even more eth when others' memes are collected via their reflink. 

![](/images/memes-for-member.png)

every time a member achieves 100 cumulative mints (sales) of their meme submissions, they're able to claim 1,000,000 member tokens. this is made possible by strategic partnerships with the incredibly helpful teams at [uplink](https://uplink.wtf) and [coinvise](https://coinvise.co).

### üè¶ member backed assets

speaking of strategic partners, we've been very fortunate to work closely with [mint.club](https://mint.club) on our flagship example of member backed assets. by visiting [coinmembercap.com](https://coinmembercap.com/) you'll quickly realise how popular this experiment has been with the farcaster community.

![](/images/coinmember-cap.png)

in collaboration with mint.club and [yougogirl.eth](https://warpcast.com/yougogirl.eth), we produced a [farcaster frame](https://warpcast.com/gami/0xbe6af682) that scans a user's pfp, determines a colour palette, and applies it to their own custom member pfp in one click. a second click takes the user to deploy their new generative art as a member backed 1155 nft on a bonding curve. nicknamed "frametech," the project is effectively friendtech on farcaster, with many possibilities for the hundreds of users who've deployed from their fid.

## ‚úä full throbble

members understand the importance of liquidity when it comes to growth, therefore a well designed liquidity mining program has been implemented. the "[member el pee](https://www.coinvise.co/gami)" program rewards 20% of member token supply to uniswap v3 liquidity providers on 0.3% fee.

![](/images/el-pee-rewards.png)

thanks to the fine folks at coinvise, custom unsiwap integration facilitates a simple claim mechanism, from which liquidity providers can withdraw rewards once thresholds are met. the program is strictly first come, first served, and reward tiers are structured as follows:

<div class="table-container">
  <table>
    <tr><th>tier</th><th>liquidity amount</th><th>duration</th><th>reward (member)</th><th>total claims</th></tr>
    <tr><td><a href="https://www.coinvise.co/gami/el-pee-gold" target="_blank">gold</a></td><td>$1,000 USD</td><td>42 days</td><td>10,000,000</td><td>30</td></tr>
    <tr><td><a href="https://www.coinvise.co/gami/el-pee-silver" target="_blank">silver</a></td><td>$500 USD</td><td>35 days</td><td>3,500,000</td><td>100</td></tr>
    <tr><td><a href="https://www.coinvise.co/gami/el-pee-bronze" target="_blank">bronze</a></td><td>$100 USD</td><td>28 days</td><td>500,000</td><td>300</td></tr>
  </table>
</div>

claims are open and early liquidity providers, who've supported the project since day one, are encouraged to visit our convise claims page once the 28 day minimum has been met. if you're unsure if this is you, simply check days since your relevant transactions on basescan.

members can add liquidity [here](https://app.uniswap.org/add/ETH/0x7d89e05c0b93b24b5cb23a073e60d008fed1acf9/3000?minPrice=0.0000000000000000000000000000000000000029543&maxPrice=338490000000000000000000000000000000000).

## üòá enlengthened ones

member is inherently a [farcaster native](https://farcaster.in) project, with members having gathered in various channels faciliated through the warpcast client. we believe this is an important distinction, as it aligns with our reputation as early adopters of new crypto primitives. find us in:

- [/members-only](https://warpcast.com/~/channel/members-only)
- [/member](https://warpcast.com/~/channel/member)
- [/fack](https://warpcast.com/~/channel/fack)

dao members can also join our private, token gated [group chat](https://warpcast.com/~/group/M81VCp0nRdyJ-5VGQvyqJA) on warpcast. it's important to unhide your member dao nft on opensea first, as ownership is checked via their api. all members are also invited to follow us on [twitter](https://twitter.com/mlmwtf), download assets from [our figma](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1339039280002577201/member), and explore relevant [github repos](https://github.com/0xigami?tab=repositories).
